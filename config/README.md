base (sql and db) files. These json files contain all the knowledge base data that is 
needed by various packages.    
* The ``tca`` and ``wikidata`` are folders corresponding to two tasks that are created by 
``benchmarks/generate_data.py``. The ``tfidf`` entity standardization approach runs on the
